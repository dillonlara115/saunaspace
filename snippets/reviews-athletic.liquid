That reality, coupled with its unbeatably low EMF levels, make owning my very own Faraday Sauna and Photon a lifesaver. I am grateful for this quality product made by SaunaSpace!”</p></div>

                <div class="review-text"><p>"I tore a quad muscle running a few years back, and my PT projected 8 weeks to recover. As a professional runner, that’s not acceptable for me. I was grateful to be able to hit the knee and quad multiple times a day with my Photon right at home, if just to warm it up before cross training sessions, but ultimately I was running again in just 4 weeks. I credit the majority of that miracle to my use of the Photon. With all the research I’ve seen behind near IR, it’s not surprising that it helps the root issues and helps avoid re-injury with added collagen and elastin to the area."</p></div>

                <div class="review-text"><p>"Using my SaunaSpace near infrared sauna has become an integral part of my daily routine. Being an elite athlete, the benefits I’ve been experiencing both pre and post training have made a huge difference. My cardio is through the roof and my recovery times are much greater. I’m able to train twice a day and wake up the next day and get straight back into my training regime at 100%. I’m grateful to now be in a position to share SaunaSpace with the rest of Wales as we look to open our Healing Hub mid 2021. Infinite gratitude and love to the SaunaSpace fam for bringing this light into the world ❤️🙏🏽"</p></div>
