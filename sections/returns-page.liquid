Keep in mind that if you waive this signature requirement, you assume responsibility for your packages as soon as your shipment is marked "Delivered" by the carrier.</p>

    <li>Items returned to us in “like-new” condition will be fully refunded.</li><li>Do not wash any fabric products; washed items are not eligible to be returned.</li>
    <li>Identified damages due to user abuse or improper packing may result in prorated reduction of refund amount.</li><li>Failure to use towels to prevent sweat from reaching the product may lead damage that may result in prorated reduction of refund amount. This is relevant for purchases that include a Bamboo Grounding Mat, such as Luminati Infrared Sauna, Faraday Infrared Sauna and Sauna Enclosure Kit.
